            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Tunebot can read in chat messages programatically, and by comparing the most recent message with a data source, will determine if a user identified the correct video game title associated with a song.<br>You can even have themed rounds! In the below interface, we see that we can select numbered rounds, and also select our current active song. During this time, once you click away from a song, Tunebot will award points based on how users were placed into the Correct Users list.</p>
